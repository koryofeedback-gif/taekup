Account ID: acct_1SZL3cRhYhunDn2j Platform Name: MyTaek (mytaek.com) Issue: When attempting to create connected accounts via the API, I receive the following error: "You must complete your platform profile to use Connect and create live connected accounts. Visit your dashboard at https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview to answer the questionnaire."

(11:57:07 PM) Leigh: Hi, Hamed! Thanks for contacting Stripe Support. This is Leigh, and will be at your service today.
(11:57:20 PM) Hamed Konarivand: Subject: Unable to create Connect accounts - "Complete platform profile" error persists after profile completion Dear Stripe Support Team, I am writing to request assistance with an issue I'm experiencing with Stripe Connect on my platform account.

(11:58:43 PM) Leigh: Thanks for sharing this his over. Allow me to further check your account.
(12:00:47 AM) Leigh: Please give me 3-5 minutes here.
(12:00:57 AM) Hamed Konarivand: sure
(12:04:38 AM) Leigh: Thanks for waiting, Hamed! Upon checking, your account Mytaek is fully verified and all set.
(12:04:43 AM) Leigh: Due to regulations in France, you can only create connected accounts using Stripe-hosted onboarding, which is why there's an error when you try to onboard connected accounts using API.
(12:05:53 AM) Leigh: I hope I was able to give more clarification to your concern.
(12:06:15 AM) Hamed Konarivand: "Thank you for confirming that! I understand that due to France regulations, I need to use Stripe-hosted onboarding. My current implementation already uses Stripe-hosted onboarding - I create an Express account via API and then redirect users to Stripe's hosted onboarding page using stripe.accountLinks.create(). Could you please clarify: Is creating Express accounts via stripe.accounts.create() not allowed for France-based platforms? Should I use a different account type or onboarding method? What is the recommended approach for platforms in France to onboard connected accounts? Thank you for your help!"
(12:07:23 AM) Leigh: That's correct. If your platform is based in France, you can't create Express connected accounts directly via stripe.accounts.create(). This restriction applies specifically to French platforms due to local regulations.
(12:07:47 AM) Leigh: Instead, you must use Stripe-hosted onboarding for connected accounts. This means you'll need to: 1. Create an Account Link or OAuth flow to start the onboarding process 2. Have your users complete the Stripe-hosted onboarding flow
(12:08:38 AM) Leigh: Wait, Hamed, let me check other updates on our end.
(12:10:13 AM) Leigh: Thanks for waiting.
(12:10:19 AM) Leigh: Please give me 3-5 minutes here.
(12:10:26 AM) Hamed Konarivand: sure
(12:13:05 AM) Leigh: You mentioned that you have already created an express conected account via API. Kindly provide me the account ID of that express account so I can further review.
(12:15:16 AM) Hamed Konarivand: We've now updated our code to use the OAuth flow instead, as recommended for French platforms. what do you think?is it a good idea
(12:17:09 AM) Leigh: Let me verify that, Hamed.
(12:19:07 AM) Leigh: Almost, done here. Just gathering all the information. Please continue to stay on the line.
(12:23:53 AM) Leigh: Thanks for waiting! Is your "Complete platform profile" error still persisting?
(12:25:29 AM) Leigh: Are you still with me?
(12:25:43 AM) Hamed Konarivand: "We haven't tested yet because we just finished updating our code to use the OAuth flow. We need to: Add our STRIPE_CLIENT_ID to the application Configure the OAuth redirect URI in Stripe settings Deploy the updated code Could you confirm: Is the OAuth flow the correct approach for French platforms? What redirect URI should we register? It will be: https://www.mytaek.com/api/stripe/connect/callback Once you confirm, we'll test and let you know if the error is resolved."
(12:27:30 AM) Leigh: Let me review your question.
(12:29:22 AM) Leigh: Consulting now here.
(12:29:38 AM) Leigh: Please continue to hold on the line.
(12:35:38 AM) Leigh: Thanks for waiting, Hamed!
(12:37:58 AM) Leigh: Let’s revisit the available onboarding options for the France platform. Due to regulations, you can onboard connected accounts using Stripe Hosted Onboarding. For more details, please refer to the following link: https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding
(12:38:49 AM) Leigh: Meaning, using Oauth and API in onboarding your connected account is currently not yet available due to France's regulations.
(12:39:54 AM) Leigh: You may create a connected account via your dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/acct_1SZL3cRhYhunDn2j/connect/accounts
(12:40:16 AM) Hamed Konarivand: Thank you for the documentation link. I see it shows creating an account with controller properties, then using Account Links. For French platforms specifically, can we: Option A: Create account with controller properties (not type: 'express') + use Account Links? stripe.accounts.create({ controller: { fees: { payer: 'application' }, losses: { payments: 'application' }, stripe_dashboard: { type: 'express' } } }); Option B: Use OAuth flow without calling accounts.create at all? Which option is compliant with French regulations?"
(12:43:50 AM) Leigh: May I know what errors are you getting?
(12:44:17 AM) Leigh: Please use the Stripe hosted onboarding and not the Oauth, Hamed.
(12:44:32 AM) Leigh: We will check your API keys one by one if you have errors.
(12:45:31 AM) Leigh: The compliant with French regulations is using the Stripe hosted onbaording: https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding?accounts-namespace=v2
(12:45:46 AM) Leigh: Please refer to this website shared.
(12:47:06 AM) Hamed Konarivand: I've updated the code to use controller properties with Account Links instead of OAuth. Here's our approach: stripe.accounts.create({ email: email, controller: { fees: { payer: 'application' }, losses: { payments: 'application' }, stripe_dashboard: { type: 'express' }, } }); Then we use stripe.accountLinks.create() for hosted onboarding. Can we test this now while you're on the line? If there's an error, you can help us debug it."
(12:47:41 AM) Leigh: Thanks for this one. Yes, please test it.
(12:47:56 AM) Leigh: Will be here to attend to your concern.
(12:49:19 AM) Hamed Konarivand: You must complete your platform profile to use Connect and create live connected accounts. Visit your dashboard at https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview to answer the questionnaire.
(12:50:06 AM) Leigh: Could you please share a screenshot of this error via this secure file link: https://dashboard.stripe.com/filepickup/fpur_1SwuIARhYhunDn2j2IWhLrIA
(12:52:28 AM) Leigh: Are you still with me?
(12:53:46 AM) Hamed Konarivand: yes i sent it
(12:54:35 AM) Leigh: Thanks for sharing! Let me take a look and consult with the technical team here.
(12:56:16 AM) Leigh: Please give us 3-5 minutes.
(01:00:53 AM) Leigh: Please continue to hold on to the line, Hamed.
(01:01:25 AM) Hamed Konarivand: "I'm still getting the same error with our updated code. Here's the error: Error: You must complete your platform profile to use Connect and create live connected accounts Request ID: req_S9ilLQoooTEFs8 But my platform profile IS complete (I showed you screenshots earlier - everything shows 'Completed February 4, 2026'). Can you check this specific request ID in your system and tell me what's actually missing? There seems to be a mismatch between what the dashboard shows and what the API is checking."
(01:04:04 AM) Leigh: Thanks for sharing this with me.
(01:04:09 AM) Leigh: I'm reaching out to a member of my team who is best positioned to help you resolve this issue, and I'll transfer you over to them now. Please allow just a few minutes for them to catch up on your situation, and they'll enter the chat to help you shortly.
(01:04:40 AM) Hamed Konarivand: great thanks
(01:05:21 AM) Leigh: You're most welcome!
(01:05:30 AM) Leigh: Transferring you now, Hamed.
(01:06:04 AM) Madison: Hi Hamed, my name is Madison and I'll be assisting you today. Please allow me to read through your message.
(01:06:22 AM) Hamed Konarivand: hello yes sure
(01:07:27 AM) Madison: I understand your concern about the issue you are encountering when creating a Connected account. Allow me to help.
(01:07:39 AM) Madison: Give me 3-5 minutes while I check this for you. I'll be right back.
(01:07:54 AM) Hamed Konarivand: thanks
(01:12:12 AM) Madison: I just need more time to review your account. Please bear with me additional 3-5 minutes to further check this for you. Thank you.
(01:12:32 AM) Hamed Konarivand: no problem
(01:17:20 AM) Madison: Kindly bear with me for additional 3-5 minutes. I'm still checking this on my end. Thank you.
(01:17:39 AM) Hamed Konarivand: ok
(01:20:19 AM) Madison: Thanks for patiently waiting, Hamed. I appreciate it.
(01:20:53 AM) Madison: I understand that my previous colleague assisted you already in going through the verification earlier.
(01:21:19 AM) Madison: Upon checking your account, the best way for me to help you here would be to convert this chat into email. This way, I can work with my team to help you your concern. We'll keep you posted via email once we have an update to share or, in case we need more information from you. I hope that's okay with you?
(01:22:18 AM) Hamed Konarivand: yes good idea,
(01:22:38 AM) Hamed Konarivand: you think tomorrow i will receive answer?
(01:22:40 AM) Madison: Thank you. For additional information, can you please describe how you intend to use Connect as part of your business model?
(01:23:05 AM) Madison: I’m afraid I won’t be able to provide a specific timeline when we can complete the review. It varies depending on the complexity of the specific process we're conducting and the information/documents required for each process.
(01:23:09 AM) Madison: Please be assured that we are working on your case, as we recognize the gravity of the situation, and we’ll get back to you as soon as we have an update to share.
(01:23:35 AM) Hamed Konarivand: thanks
(01:24:20 AM) Madison: You're welcome. Can you please describe how you intend to use Connect as part of your business model?
(01:26:28 AM) Hamed Konarivand: TaekUp is a martial arts club management platform. We use Stripe Connect to share subscription revenue with clubs. How it works: Parents pay $4.99/month for premium features We split this revenue: 70% goes to the club, 30% to platform We use transfer_data with destination to automatically send 70% ($3.28) to the club's connected account Flow: Club owner connects their Stripe account via our platform When a parent subscribes, the payment goes to our platform account We automatically transfer 70% to the club's connected account This is a standard marketplace revenue-sharing model."
(01:27:13 AM) Madison: Thank you for providing that information. I will go ahead and share this with my team. In the meantime, would there be anything else that I can help you with today?
(01:27:30 AM) Hamed Konarivand: no thanks
(01:27:38 AM) Hamed Konarivand: have a great time
