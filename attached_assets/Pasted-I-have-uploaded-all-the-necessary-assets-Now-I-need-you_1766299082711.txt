I have uploaded all the necessary assets. Now, I need you to implement the full Game Logic for Levels 1, 2, and 3 based on the "Spirit Guardian" design.

Please update `App.jsx` (and create a separate `GameLogic.js` if needed) to handle this exact flow.

### 🛠️ IMPORTANT: Developer Testing Panel
Since I cannot do real workouts right now, please create a temporary **"Dev Panel"** (a small box in the corner) with these buttons so I can test the logic immediately:
1.  `[Simulate: 300 XP]` (Fills the bar instantly)
2.  `[Set Type: Power/Red]` (Sets training type to Red)
3.  `[Set Type: Tech/Blue]` (Sets training type to Blue)
4.  `[Reset Day]` (Resets the bar to 0)

### 🟢 Level 1: The Awakening (Day 1)
* **Visual:** Show `egg_dormant.png`.
* **Logic:**
    * User holds the "HOLD TO INFUSE" button.
    * Play `sfx_charge.mp3` looping while holding.
    * Fill the progress bar from 0 to 300.
* **Completion (When bar hits 300):**
    * Play `sfx_crack.mp3`.
    * Change image to `egg_crack_yellow.png`.
    * Show Modal: "Something moved! The egg is tired. Come back tomorrow."
    * Button in modal: "Okay" (Disables the game for "today").

### 🔵🔴 Level 2: The Pulse (Day 2)
* **Visual:**
    * If I clicked `[Set Type: Power/Red]` -> Show `egg_crack_red.png`.
    * If I clicked `[Set Type: Tech/Blue]` -> Show `egg_crack_blue.png`.
    * (Default if nothing clicked: `egg_crack_yellow.png`).
* **Logic:**
    * User holds button to fill bar again (0 to 300).
    * Play `sfx_heartbeat.mp3` (speed increases as bar fills).
* **Completion:**
    * Vibrate device (if supported).
    * Show Modal: "Ready to Hatch! The shell is weak. Prepare for the final strike tomorrow."

### 🐣 Level 3: The Hatching (Day 3)
* **Visual:** The egg (Red or Blue) should be shaking (CSS animation).
* **Interaction Change:**
    * Button text changes to **"TAP TO BREAK"**.
    * User must TAP (click) the egg/button 20 times rapidly.
* **Completion:**
    * Play `sfx_hatch.mp3`.
    * **Flash effect:** White screen overlay fades out.
    * **Result:** Show `char_baby.png` sitting on top of `egg_broken.png`.
    * Show Final Modal: "The Guardian is Awake! What is its name?" with an input field.

### CSS & Styling Notes
* Use the `bg_dojo.jpg` as the background.
* Ensure the Egg sits perfectly on the Pedestal.
* The Progress Bar needs to be styled with `ui_bar_frame.png` and `ui_bar_fill.png`.
* Ensure the "Hold" button uses `ui_btn_hold.png`.

Please write the complete code. I want to test the RED/BLUE logic using the Dev Panel buttons.
