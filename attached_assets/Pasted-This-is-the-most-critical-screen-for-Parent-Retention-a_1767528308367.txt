This is the most critical screen for **Parent Retention** (and getting them to pay the extra fee).

If this dashboard looks like a "Utility Bill" or "School Report Card," parents will ignore it.
It needs to look like a **Video Game Interface (HUD)**.

Here is the **Strategic Renaming** to match our "TaekUp/DojoMint" ecosystem.

### 1. The Strategy: "From Student to Player"

* **Old Concept:** Managing a student.
* **New Concept:** Managing a character (RPG Style).

We need to inject **"FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out)** into the free version so they want to upgrade to "Legacy Status."

**[ THE GRID MENU - Renamed for "Cool Factor" ]**

| **Icon** | **New Name** | **Subtitle** | **Why?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🏅 | **Legacy Card** | *Digital ID & Rarity* | Makes the ID feel like a collectible card (Pokemon/FIFA). |
| 🏠 | **Dojo Quests** | *Daily Habits & XP* | "Habits" sounds like chores. "Quests" sounds like fun. |
| ⚔️ | **Battle Arena** | *Leagues & Challenges* | "Arena" implies action and competition. |
| 📅 | **Training Ops** | *Book Classes* | "Schedule" is boring. "Ops" (Operations) sounds tactical. |
| 🔮 | **Chronos Forecast** | *AI Black Belt Date* | "Future" is vague. "Chronos" brands your AI tech. |
| 📊 | **Warrior Stats** | *Skills & Analytics* | "Stats" is okay, but "Warrior Stats" empowers the kid. |

**[ SENSEI FEEDBACK ]**
💬 **Sensei Intel:**
*"No active missions yet. Keep training hard!"*

### 💡 Key Strategic Changes explained:

1. **"Initiate" vs. "Legacy" Status:**
* By showing a status badge at the top (🛡️ Initiate), you subtly tell the parent: *"You are on the basic plan."*
* When they click it, it opens the "Upgrade to Legacy" screen (where you make money).


2. **"Training Streak" instead of "Attendance":**
* Attendance is a metric for *you* (the business).
* Streak is a metric for *them* (the psychology). Kids hate breaking streaks (like in Duolingo or Snapchat).


3. **"Chronos Forecast" instead of "Future":**
* This protects your AI secret. If Kicksite sees "Future," they think "Calendar." If they see "Chronos," they think "Proprietary Tech."


4. **"Upgrade" in Bottom Nav:**
* Instead of "Card" in the bottom right, put **Upgrade** or a **Gem Icon 💎**. This is the constant reminder to unlock the full potential (and pay the club owner).



**Are you happy with "Chronos Forecast" for the AI prediction? Or do you prefer "Oracle"?**
