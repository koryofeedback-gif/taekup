Okay, the desktop container looks good now. But the internal layout is broken. The elements are floating unnaturally because their vertical positioning is wrong.

We need to anchor everything from the **BOTTOM** of the screen to stack them correctly on the "floor" of the dojo background.

Here is the precise CSS strategy to fix the placements. Please update the CSS for these elements:

**1. The UI Container (Buttons & Bar - "Stone Keys"):**
Currently, they are not aligned well.
* **Fix:** Ensure the UI container is absolutely positioned at the very bottom. Use Flexbox to center them horizontally and stack them vertically with gaps.
    ```css
    .ui-container {
        position: absolute;
        bottom: 30px; /* Padding from bottom edge */
        left: 50%;
        transform: translateX(-50%);
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column; /* Stack vertically */
        align-items: center; /* Center horizontally */
        gap: 20px; /* Space between bar and button */
        width: 100%; /* Ensure full width for centering */
    }
    /* Make sure images inside aren't too big */
    .ui-bar-frame, .ui-btn-action {
        width: 80%; /* Adjust width as needed */
        max-width: 300px;
    }
    ```

**2. The Pedestal (Stone Base):**
Currently, it's floating too high in the middle of the room. It needs to sit on the floor, just above the UI.
* **Fix:** Lower its position significantly.
    ```css
    .pedestal-image {
        position: absolute;
        bottom: 160px; /* Sit above the UI elements */
        left: 50%;
        transform: translateX(-50%);
        width: 70%; /* Adjust scale so it looks right on the floor */
        max-width: 350px;
        z-index: 5;
    }
    ```

**3. The Egg:**
Currently, it's too low (sinking into the stone). It needs to sit *exactly on top* of the pedestal.
* **Fix:** Its `bottom` value must be higher than the pedestal's.
    ```css
    .egg-image {
        position: absolute;
        bottom: 250px; /* Must be higher than pedestal's bottom (160px) + pedestal's approximate height */
        left: 50%;
        transform: translateX(-50%);
        width: 50%; /* Egg should be smaller than pedestal */
        max-width: 250px;
        z-index: 6; /* Must be on top of pedestal */
    }
    ```

**Summary of Action:** Please rewrite the CSS using these `bottom`, `left: 50%`, and `transform: translateX(-50%)` rules to stack the elements correctly from bottom to top: UI -> Pedestal -> Egg.
