1. Terms of Service (The "Anti-Copy" Shield) 🛡️
Key Strategy: This document explicitly forbids reverse-engineering your unique gamification logic (HonorXP, DojoMint) and establishes MyTaek Inc. as the sole owner of the platform design.

# Terms of Service
**Last Updated:** January 2026

Welcome to TaekUp, a platform operated by **MyTaek Inc.** ("Company", "we", "us"). By accessing our website or mobile application, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Intellectual Property & Brand Protection
The TaekUp platform, including its source code, database structures, algorithms, and User Interface design (UI/UX), is the exclusive property of MyTaek Inc.

**Strictly Prohibited:**
* You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any aspect of the platform.
* **Trade Dress:** The specific combination of features known as **HonorXP™**, **Legacy Cards™**, **Global Shogun Rank™**, and the **DojoMint™ Protocol** are protected trade dress of MyTaek Inc. Copying these gamification mechanics or terminologies is a violation of our intellectual property rights.

## 2. Accounts & Usage
* **Club Owners:** You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Stripe Connect account credentials.
* **Parents/Guardians:** You must be at least 18 years old to create an account. You grant consent for your child’s participation and video uploads.

## 3. Payments & Revenue Split (The DojoMint™ Model)
* **SaaS Fees:** Club Owners agree to a monthly or yearly software licensing fee (e.g., $24.99/mo) for access to the dashboard.
* **Marketplace Fees:** For student subscriptions (e.g., $4.99/mo), the Platform automatically deducts a service fee (approximately 30%) and Stripe processing fees before transferring the remaining balance (approximately 70%) to the Club Owner's connected Stripe account.
* **Refunds:** SaaS fees are non-refundable. Student subscription refunds are handled at the discretion of the Club Owner.

## 4. User-Generated Content (Videos)
* **Ownership:** Parents/Students retain ownership of their training videos.
* **License:** By uploading, you grant MyTaek Inc. a worldwide, royalty-free license to host, encode, and process these videos for the purpose of providing the Service (e.g., for Coach review).

## 5. Physical Safety Disclaimer
Martial arts involve physical exertion. MyTaek Inc. is a technology provider, not a fitness instructor. We are not liable for any physical injuries that occur while practicing moves seen on or uploaded to the App. Practice safely and under supervision.

## 6. Termination
We reserve the right to terminate accounts that violate these terms or attempt to clone/scrape our data.

**Contact:** legal@mytaek.com
2. Privacy Policy (COPPA & Trust) 🔒
Key Strategy: Because you have users under 13, this policy focuses on parental consent. It also builds trust by stating you don't sell data.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### 🥋 For Club Owners
**Q: How do I get paid?**
A: We use Stripe Connect. You receive roughly 70% of all net revenue from your students' subscriptions. Payouts are transferred automatically to your bank account on a rolling basis (usually every 2 days).

**Q: Why do I need to connect a Stripe account?**
A: This is required to legally split the revenue. Without a connected account, we cannot send your share of the earnings.

#### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 For Parents
**Q: How do I upload a video?**
A: Go to the "Training" tab, select the technique, and tap "Upload". Your Sensei will review it within 24-48 hours.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes. You can cancel your $4.99/mo subscription from your Profile settings. Your child's rank will be frozen but not deleted.
