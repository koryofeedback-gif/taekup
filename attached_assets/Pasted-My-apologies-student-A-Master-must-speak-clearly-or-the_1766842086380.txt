My apologies, student. A Master must speak clearly or the lesson is lost.

Here is the **FINAL VERSION**. Do not change it. This is the perfect balance of "Fun for Kids" and "Helpful for Parents."

Copy this exactly into your app.

### 1. The Standard "Home Dojo" List (Free Users)

*Instead of boring chore names, we use "Ninja Mission" names. This tricks the brain into thinking it is a game.*

**Total XP:** 60 XP (15 XP per habit)

| Icon | **Habit Title** (What the Kid sees) | **Description** (What the Parent checks) | Why this works |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🏯 | **Secure the Base** | Did they make their bed? | "Secure" sounds like a military mission. |
| 🛡️ | **Polish the Armor** | Did they brush teeth & wash face? | "Armor" makes hygiene feel strong, not boring. |
| 🥋 | **The First Command** | Did they listen the **first time** asked? | "Respect" is vague. "Listening first time" is a specific rule. |
| 🤝 | **Serve the Tribe** | Did they help with chores? | "Tribe" makes the family feel like a team. |

### 2. The Premium Customization (For Paid Users)

*Do not just give a blank list. Give parents "Packs" to solve their specific headaches.*

#### 🦁 Pack A: The "Focus Master" (For School)

* 📚 **Scholar's Mind:** Finished homework before screens/play.
* 🎒 **Prepare for Battle:** Packed their own school bag the night before.

#### 🕊️ Pack B: The "Peacekeeper" (For Siblings)

* 🤐 **The Shield of Silence:** Walked away from an argument instead of yelling.
* 👼 **Kindness Warrior:** Said something nice to a sibling or parent.

#### 🥦 Pack C: The "Iron Body" (For Health)

* ⚡ **Fuel the Machine:** Ate vegetables/healthy food without complaining.
* 💧 **Potion of Life:** Drank water instead of soda/juice.

### 3. The "Success Message" (The Reward)

*When the parent clicks "Yes" to confirm the habit, show this text to the kid:*

* **If 1 Habit Complete:** "Good start. Discipline increasing."
* **If All 4 Habits Complete:** "PERFECT DAY! 🌟 You are living like a Black Belt."

### Master's Instructions for Implementation:

1. **Keep the max XP at 60.** It is a good number.
2. **Use the new names.** "Secure the Base" is infinitely better than "Make Bed."
3. **For Premium:** Allow parents to swap out "Serve the Tribe" for "Scholar's Mind" if school is the priority that day.

**Is this clear? Can you put this directly into your design?**
