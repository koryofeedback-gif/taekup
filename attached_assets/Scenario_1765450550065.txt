​GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT (GDD)
​Project Name: DOJO EVOLUTION
Version: 1.0 (Master Plan)
Platform: Mobile Web (React/PWA)
Genre: 2D Gamified Pet Collection (Gacha RPG)
​1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
​Dojo Evolution is a 2D gamification layer integrated into an existing Martial Arts Management App (TaekUp). It motivates students (Ages 9–18) to train in real life by converting their physical effort into digital progression.
• ​Core Concept: "Train IRL → Evolve your Spirit Pet → Build your Dojo."
• ​Key Constraint: This is a Web App running inside a React environment. No heavy 3D engines.
​2. ART STYLE & TARGET AUDIENCE
• ​Target Audience: Kids & Teens (9 to 18 years old).
• ​Visual Style: High-Quality "Shonen Anime" Style. 
• ​Avoid: Childish, round, "Paw Patrol" style cartoons.
• ​Prefer: Sharp lines, glowing effects, cool silhouettes (References: Solo Leveling, Demon Slayer, Pokémon/Digimon).
• ​Goal: A 16-year-old Black Belt should feel the pet looks "cool," not "cringe."
​3. THE ECONOMY (DUAL CURRENCY SYSTEM)
​To prevent player anxiety (hoarding XP), the game uses two distinct resources:
​A. XP (Evolution Energy)
• ​Source: Earned strictly from real-world training/attendance.
• ​Use: Automatically fills the "Evolution Bar" of the Pet and unlocks new Worlds.
• ​Logic: Cannot be spent. It is a cumulative score of effort.
​B. Spirit Tokens (Gacha Currency)
• ​Source: Earned alongside XP (e.g., Get 1000 XP + 10 Spirit Tokens).
• ​Use: Spent to spin the "Summon Wheel" (Gacha) to get items/decorations.
• ​Logic: Players can spend these freely without slowing down their pet’s growth.
​4. CORE GAMEPLAY LOOPS
​Loop 1: The Pet System (Evolution & Interaction)
​Every player starts with a Mystic Egg.
• ​Evolution: As XP accumulates and "Real Life Belt" rank increases, the pet evolves: 
• ​Stage 1: Egg
• ​Stage 2: Baby Spirit (Cute)
• ​Stage 3: Beast (Cool/Strong)
• ​Stage 4: Master Entity (God-tier/Glowing/Epic)
• ​Micro-Interactions (Juicy Clicks): 
• ​Tapping the pet triggers animations (Roar, Sparkles, Backflip).
• ​"Cleaning" or "Petting" action gives a small temporary visual boost.
​Loop 2: The Mood System (Positive Reinforcement)
​The pet’s mood reflects the student's training frequency.
• ​Active (3+ days/week): "Hyper Mode" (Glowing, fast animations).
• ​Inactive (Absent for 1 week): "Meditation Mode" (NOT Sad). 
• ​The pet goes into a stone statue/sleep state to preserve energy.
• ​The Hook: When the student returns and trains, a massive "Resurrection Animation" plays (breaking the stone shell), making the return feel heroic, not punishing.
​Loop 3: The Gacha & Inventory
• ​The Wheel: Players spend Spirit Tokens to spin.
• ​Rewards: 
• ​Decorations: Banners, Statues, Weapons for the Dojo wall.
• ​Visual Effects: Aura colors for the pet.
• ​Rarity: Common (Grey) → Rare (Blue) → Epic (Purple) → Legendary (Gold).
​5. WORLD PROGRESSION (The Biomes)
​Static but beautiful 2.5D backgrounds (Parallax effect) that unlock based on Total XP.
• ​Forest of Beginnings (Bamboo forest, light rays).
• ​Mountain Peak (Wind effects, rocks).
• ​Frozen Lake (Ice sparkles, snow particles).
• ​Volcanic Core (Heat distortion, embers).
• ​Cosmic Void (Stars, galaxy background - for Black Belts).
​Note: Players cannot enter a higher biome until their Real Life Belt matches the requirement in the database.
​6. DOJO CUSTOMIZATION (MVP Version)
​To keep technical complexity low for V1:
• ​The user has a "Personal Dojo" background.
• ​There are 5 Fixed Slots (Left Wall, Right Wall, Ceiling, Floor, Center).
• ​User taps a slot → Selects an owned item from Inventory to display.
• ​No free-form drag and drop.
​7. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (For Developer)
• ​Tech Stack: React.js (Component-based). Must be easily importable into a Replit/Vercel project.
• ​Responsiveness: Mobile-First design. Must look like a native app on a phone browser.
• ​Data Sync: 
• ​User_XP and User_Belt are read-only inputs from the main app API.
• ​Inventory, Pet_Stage, and Spirit_Tokens are managed by the game database.
• ​Performance: Use CSS animations, Lottie files, or Canvas. NO Unity WebGL (loading times are too high).
• ​Deliverable: A clean GitHub repository or Replit Fork.
