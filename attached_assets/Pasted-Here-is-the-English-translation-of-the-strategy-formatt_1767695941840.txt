Here is the English translation of the strategy, formatted for your developer and design team:The Monetization Strategy you choose must be built on "Parental Psychology" and "Child Excitement".I have analyzed every screenshot you uploaded. To convince parents to pay $4.99/mo (or more), you must target either their "Pain" (solving behavior issues) or their "Pride" (seeing their child succeed).Here is the precise list of what must be Locked and what should remain Free to maintain the perfect balance:1. World Rank (Global Leaderboard) - 🌍 " The Sense of Pride"This is your strongest selling point. Parents love the idea of their child being a "World Champion."Free Version:View Club Rank only.In the Global Section, they only see their own specific number (e.g., "Rank #1250"), but they cannot see the list of top players.Premium (Legacy) Version:Unlock the full Global Leaderboard.See exactly how many points they are behind the #1 student in the world.UI Note: Apply a Blur Effect to the global list and overlay the text: "See where you stand among 5,000 students worldwide."2. Chronos Forecast (Black Belt Prediction) - 🔮 "Future Vision"Parents love knowing, "When will my investment pay off?"Free Version:Do NOT show the exact date. Just display: "Calculating Journey..." or a vague range (e.g., "2027").The Training Frequency Slider is locked.Premium (Legacy) Version:Reveal the Exact Date (e.g., July 14, 2026).Unlock the "Time Machine" Slider: Parents can adjust attendance (e.g., increase to 3x/week) to see how much faster their child will graduate.3. AI Parenting Coach - 🧠 "Exclusive Guidance"For modern parents worried about child development, this is gold.Free Version:Show a disabled button or just a single Generic Tip.Premium (Legacy) Version:Detailed analysis of the child's performance by AI.Specific advice, such as: "Your child’s discipline is up 10%, but focus is low. Try asking them about their breathing technique tonight."4. Sensei Academy - 🎥 "Home Training"Free Version:Only the first 1 or 2 videos (e.g., White Belt Form) are unlocked.Premium (Legacy) Version:Access to the Full Video Library and advanced techniques.Ability to Upload Videos for the coach to review (Video Check-in).5. Daily Quests (Home Habits) - 🏠 "Behavior Control"Parents want their kids to be disciplined at home (brushing teeth, making the bed).Free Version:Only 3 Fixed Habits (Brush Teeth, Make Bed, Respect). These cannot be changed.Premium (Legacy) Version:Unlock "Custom Quests": Parents can add their own tasks (e.g., "Finish Math Homework," "Clean Room").Why this sells: This feature is insanely attractive to parents because it makes their daily life easier!6. Legacy Card (Athlete Card) - 🏅 "Social Flex"Kids love collecting trading cards (like FIFA or Pokémon).Free Version:Basic Blue Card.No option to download high-quality PDF.Premium (Legacy) Version:Gold/Holographic (Shiny) Card.Ability to Download & Print the card to put in their school backpack.Strategy Summary (Freemium Model)FeatureFree VersionPremium (Legacy) VersionBuying HookAttendance✅ Full Access✅ Full Access(Core Utility)Rankings🏠 Club Only🌍 Global + NationalPride & CompetitionFuture (AI)❌ Blurred✅ Exact Date + Time MachineVisualizing the GoalStats (AI Coach)❌ None✅ Psychological AnalysisBetter ParentingQuests🔒 3 Fixed✅ Unlimited + CustomHome Behavior ControlAcademy🔒 2 Videos✅ Full LibraryFaster ProgressMystery Quiz🔒 1 per day✅ Unlimited + Bonus RewardsSmart EntertainmentMy UI Recommendation (Teaser Strategy)In all the screens you uploaded, do not remove the Premium buttons.
