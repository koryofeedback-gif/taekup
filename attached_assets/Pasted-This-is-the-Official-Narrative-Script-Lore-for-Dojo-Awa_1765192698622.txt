This is the **Official Narrative Script & Lore** for *Dojo Awakening*.

This story is designed to be **episodic** (like an anime or a Netflix series). It solves the retention problem by giving the student a "Hero’s Purpose." They aren't just doing push-ups; they are saving the universe.

## The Prologue: The Shattered Balance
*(This plays as a cinematic video when the student first downloads the app)*

> "Long ago, the world of **Taek** was held together by the **Prism Belt**—a mystical artifact worn by the Great Grandmaster. It balanced the energies of Earth, Water, Fire, and Spirit.
>
> But the **Shadow Legion**, born from laziness and undisciplined minds, shattered the Belt. The shards were scattered across dangerous realms.
>
> Without the Belt, the Spirit Beasts went into a deep sleep, and the world began to fade into grey.
>
> You are the **Awakened One**. You have been chosen to travel the realms, find the shards, wake the Spirit Beasts, and restore the Prism Belt. But be warned... your spirit is strong, but your physical vessel is weak. You must train."

## Why This Story Works for Business?

1.  **The "Egg" Hook (Tamagotchi Effect):**
    * In the first month (White Belt), the child *cannot* leave the club because they want to see what is inside the egg. Curiosity drives retention.

2.  **The "Cliffhangers" (Limit Breakers):**
    * At the end of every belt, the story explicitly **stops**. The student is stuck at a gate. The *only* key is the instructor's approval (grading). This turns the instructor into the "Hero Maker."

3.  **The Visual Progression:**
    * A White Belt looks like a peasant (Cloth gear).
    * A Red Belt looks like a Warlord (Fire gear).
    * A Black Belt looks like a God (Cosmic gear).
    * This visual hierarchy makes students desperate to upgrade their status.

4.  **Flexible Lore:**
    * This story works for **Taekwondo** (Kicks/Speed).
    * It works for **BJJ** (Grappling/Control).
    * It works for **Karate** (Strikes/Power).
    * You just change the names of the "Regions," but the structure (Forest -> Mountain -> Fire -> Space) remains the same.

This is the script. It provides the emotional context for every push-up, every grading fee, and every login.
