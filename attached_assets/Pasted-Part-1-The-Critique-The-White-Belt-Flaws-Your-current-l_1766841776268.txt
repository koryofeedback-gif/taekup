Part 1: The Critique (The White Belt Flaws)
Your current list is functional, but it lacks The Warrior Spirit.

"Did they brush their teeth?" -> This is hygiene, not martial arts. It’s boring.

"Did they show respect to parents?" -> Dangerous. This is too vague. A child will say "Yes," a stressed parent will say "No." You need concrete actions (e.g., "Did they answer with 'Yes' immediately?" or "Did they bow?").

"Did they help with chores?" -> Again, feels like a job.

Verdict: It is "good," but it is not "engaging." It feels like a checklist on a refrigerator, not a path to mastery.

Part 2: The Remastered "Home Dojo" (The Black Belt Upgrade)
We will keep the same habits, but we will rename them and add flavor text. This changes the psychology from "I have to do this" to "I am leveling up."

The 4 Pillars of the Home Dojo
1. The Tatami Check (Orderliness)

Old Name: Make Bed.

The Logic: A chaotic room equals a chaotic mind.

App Text: "Secure the Perimeter." (Did you make your bed and clear your floor?)

2. Armor Maintenance (Health)

Old Name: Brush Teeth.

The Logic: Your body is your weapon and your armor. You must polish it.

App Text: "Polish the Armor." (Teeth brushed, face washed, uniform folded?)

3. The Code of Honor (Character)

Old Name: Show Respect.

The Logic: Respect must be actionable.

App Text: "The First Command." (Did you listen the first time you were asked, without arguing?)

4. Service to the Tribe (Chores)

Old Name: Help with Chores.

The Logic: A warrior serves others.

App Text: "Serve the Tribe." (Did you complete one task to help the family without being asked?)

Part 3: The Premium Customization (The Secret Scrolls) ⚙️
You asked about the Customization Tool. This is your gold mine. Parents are desperate for help with specific behaviors (Screen time, eating vegetables, fighting with siblings).

Do not just give them a blank list. As a Training Designer, I advise you to offer "Habit Packs" based on what the parent wants to fix.

Recommended Preset Packs for Premium:
Pack A: The Focus Master (For distracted kids)

📚 Scholar's Mind: Finished homework before screens.

🎒 Prepare the Gear: Packed own school bag the night before.

Pack B: The Peaceful Warrior (For kids who fight siblings)

🤝 The Alliance: Played with sibling for 20 mins without fighting.

🤐 The Shield of Silence: Walked away from an argument instead of shouting.

Pack C: The Iron Body (For health/diet)

🥦 Fuel the Machine: Ate a vegetable without complaining.

💧 Potion of Life: Drank 3 glasses of water.

Part 4: The UX Strategy (Making it Addictive)
To make this "Perfect," you need one visual element: The Streak Flame.

If a child hits 60/60 XP for 3 days in a row, show a Blue Flame icon next to their profile.

If they hit 7 days, it turns into a Golden Dragon.

If they miss a day, the flame goes out.

Why? Kids do not care about the "Bed." They care about keeping the Dragon alive.
