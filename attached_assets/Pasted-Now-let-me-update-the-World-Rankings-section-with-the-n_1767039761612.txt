Now let me update the World Rankings section with the new tier-based display:


Reviewing tier-based avatar system

Verifying World Rankings avatar system
Done! The tier-based avatar system is now live. Here's what you get:

✅ What's Built
World Rankings Section (Ranks Tab)
Your Avatar Display:

Glowing circular avatar frame that changes color based on tier
Your tier icon in the center (🥋 → ⚡ → 🛡️ → 🐉 → 🏆)
Rank badge showing your worldwide position
Tier name displayed (e.g., "Rising Challenger")
Progress Bar:

Shows how close you are to the next tier
"45 XP to go" countdown
Gradient colors transitioning from current to next tier
Next Unlock Preview:

Shows what features you'll unlock at the next tier
e.g., "🔓 Unlock at Guardian: Emerald guardian aura, Shield frame effect"
Anti-Cheat Features
Global Leaderboard: Shows tier icons + names instead of exact XP
Local Club Leaderboard: Only YOU see your own XP; others see rank only
No one can reverse-engineer challenge point values anymore!

Want me to add the tier-up celebration animation (confetti when you reach a new tier)?

yes

Now let me add the celebration modal UI. I'll find where the component renders and add the modal:


Reviewing tier-up celebration animation
Optimized Agent memory
I've implemented the tier-up celebration animation. When a student's Global XP crosses a tier threshold, they'll now see:

Celebration Features:

Confetti burst - Tier-colored particles rain down from both sides for 3 seconds
Celebration modal with:
Large animated tier icon with glow effect
"TIER UP!" headline
New tier name in the tier's signature color
Glowing avatar frame preview
List of newly unlocked features (e.g., "Profile Frame", "Chat Access", etc.)
"Awesome! 🎉" dismiss button
Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
The system tracks the previous tier and detects when Global XP changes cause a tier advancement, working properly even for students starting from 0 XP who jump directly into a higher tier.
