Here is the complete strategy and instruction set translated into English, ready for you to use with your developer or Replit agent.

### **Strategic Update: SenseiVault™ Estimator**

Here is the refined, strategic version for the Demo environment:

#### **1. Rebranding (Prestige & Protection)**

The name "Profit Engine Simulator" is too dry and technical. We need to make it sound proprietary and valuable.

* ❌ **Old:** Profit Engine Simulator
* ✅ **Strategic Proposal:** **SenseiVault™ Estimator**
* *Why?* The word "Vault" implies security and stored wealth.



#### **2. Description Text (The Hook)**

**Current Text:** "See how Premium Subscriptions offset your software costs."
*Critique:* This explicitly mentions "Subscriptions," which we want to obscure to prevent Kicksite from copying the model.

* ✅ **Strategic Proposal:**
> **"See how DojoMint™ protocol turns student engagement into net profit."**



#### **3. Visual Logic (The Visual Magic)**

**Current Logic:** "If 40% of your 25 students subscribe..."
**New Logic:** We need to make the result more dramatic.
In the Demo, when the slider moves and hits the Break-even Point, a **compelling animation** must trigger:

1. The software cost ($24.99) should be **crossed out** (Strikethrough).
2. A bright green badge should appear: **🎉 100% COVERED** (or "SOFTWARE IS FREE").
3. The profit number (+$9.91) must become **Large and Green**.

#### **4. Final Copy for UI (Copy-Paste this)**

Give this exact text block to Replit/Developer to implement in the UI:

```text
HEADER: SenseiVault™ Estimator
SUB-HEADER: Activate DojoMint™ to cover your platform costs automatically.

[ SLIDER INTERFACE ]
Label: "If 40% of your Active Warriors upgrade via the app..."

[ RESULT BOX ]
--------------------------------------------------
Your Platform Cost:      $̶2̶4̶.̶9̶9̶   (FREE) ✅
Your DojoMint™ Income:   +$34.90
--------------------------------------------------
NET MONTHLY PROFIT:      +$9.91 🚀
--------------------------------------------------
(Paid via Performance Royalty)

```

#### **5. Default State (Psychological Trigger)**

**Crucial Psychological Note:**
When the "Load Sample Dojo" (Demo) loads, **DO NOT set the slider to 0%.**
Set the slider default to **40% or 50%**.

* *Why?* The very first thing the instructor sees should be the color **Green** and the word **PROFIT**.
* They should have to "break" it (slide it left to lose money), rather than "fix" it. This triggers **Loss Aversion**.

### **Prompt for Replit (To implement this immediately)**

You can copy and paste the block below directly into Replit:

```text
I need to update the "Profit Calculator" component in the Dashboard (specifically for the Demo Mode). Please apply these changes to the UI text and logic:

1. REBRANDING:
   - Change the Title from "Profit Engine Simulator" to "SenseiVault™ Estimator".
   - Change the Subtitle to: "See how DojoMint™ protocol turns student engagement into net profit."

2. UI TEXT UPDATES:
   - Change the slider label to: "If [X]% of your Active Warriors upgrade via the app..."
   - Change the footer note to: "(Paid via Performance Royalty)"

3. VISUAL LOGIC (Crucial):
   - When the calculated income exceeds the software cost ($24.99):
     a. Apply a strikethrough effect to the "$24.99" cost (e.g., $̶2̶4̶.̶9̶9̶).
     b. Display a green badge next to it that says "FREE" or "100% COVERED".
     c. Highlight the "Net Monthly Profit" in bold Green text.

4. DEFAULT STATE:
   - When the component loads, set the default slider percentage to 40% (so the user immediately sees a profit state).

Please implement this using the new brand terms (DojoMint™, SenseiVault™, Active Warriors).
