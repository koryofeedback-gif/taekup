Based on the **Sensei Academy** interface and the "Legacy" gamification model we established, here is the best way to split the content between Free and Premium.

The goal is to make the **Free** version useful enough to build a habit, but make the **Premium** version necessary for *promotion* and *faster leveling up*.

### The "Curriculum & XP" Split Strategy

#### 1. Free Tier (The "Initiate" Access)

* **Content:**
* **The Basics:** "How to tie your belt," "Dojo Etiquette," and "Warm-up routines."
* **Current Belt Preview:** Only the **first 2 videos** of their *current* belt requirement (e.g., "Basic Stance" and "Punch 1").
* **PDFs:** All PDF guides (static content is less valuable than video).


* **XP Reward:**
* Standard XP (e.g., +10 XP per video).
* **Cap:** They can only earn XP from these videos once.



#### 2. Premium Tier (The "Legacy" Access) 💎

* **Content:**
* **Full Curriculum:** The complete video library for their belt (Forms/Poomsae, Sparring drills, Self-defense).
* **"Next Level" Peek:** Access to view the videos for the *next* belt level (kids love seeing what comes next).
* **Exclusive Skills:** "Cool" content like "Flying Kicks," "Board Breaking Tips," or "Weapon Training."


* **XP Reward:**
* **Double XP:** +20 XP per video.
* **Repeatable Practice:** Earn +5 XP every time they re-watch and practice (capped daily) to encourage grinding.

### UI Implementation (Visual Strategy)

Do not hide the Premium videos in the Free version. **Show them, but lock them.** This creates "Visual FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out).

**[ UI Layout Suggestion for Developer ]**

**1. The "Open" Section (Top of List):**

* 🎥 **Video:** "White Belt Form - Part 1"
* **Status:** ▶️ Play (Free)
* **Reward:** ⭐ +15 XP

**2. The "Locked" Section (Below):**

* 🎥 **Video:** "White Belt Form - Full Routine"
* **Status:** 🔒 **Locked** (Premium Only)
* **Reward:** ⭐ **+50 XP** (High value!)

**3. The "Trigger":**
When a parent clicks the locked video, show this pop-up:

> **"Master the Moves at Home"**
> *Unlock the full video curriculum to help [Child Name] prepare for their next belt test.*
> [ Upgrade to Legacy - $4.99 ]

### Why this works?

* **For the Parent:** They see the "Free" videos are good, but incomplete. If they want their child to pass the belt test, they realize the "Full Routine" video is worth $4.99 alone.
* **For the Child:** They see the **+50 XP** behind the lock. They will beg their parents to unlock it so they can rank up in the **Global Leaderboard**.

### Admin Setup for Coach

In the "Creator Hub" (Coach Admin), add a simple toggle next to each uploaded video:

* [ ] **Public (Free)**
* [✅] **Legacy Only (Premium)**

*Recommendation:* Tell coaches to mark 20% of their content as "Public" and 80% as "Legacy Only."
