Have more queries?
How does IDrive® e2 calculate service charges for Pay As You Go pricing model?
IDrive® e2 calculates the service charge based on the amount of active storage used during the billing cycle. There are no additional charges for ingress, egress, data deletion, and API requests.

Does IDrive® e2 have a minimum storage fee for the Pay As You Go pricing model?
Yes, IDrive® e2 charges a minimum storage fee of $5 associated with 1 TB of active cloud storage. If you store less than 1 TB, you will still be charged for the entire 1 TB. For example, if you store 900 GB with IDrive® e2 for the duration of a billing cycle, this is less than the 1 TB monthly minimum storage volume. Therefore, you will still be charged $5 for the 1 TB base storage.

Does IDrive® e2 impose a minimum storage duration policy?
No, unlike most competitors in the market, IDrive® e2 does not impose a minimum storage duration on uploaded objects nor charge users for deleting the objects.
