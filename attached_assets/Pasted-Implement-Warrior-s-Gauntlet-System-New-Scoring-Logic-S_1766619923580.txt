Implement "Warrior's Gauntlet" System & New Scoring Logic
Subject: Overhaul Arena/General Section with Fixed 7-Day Cycle & New XP Matrix

Context: We are replacing the random/custom General challenges with a fixed, professional 7-day rotation called "The Warrior's Gauntlet". These are System Challenges (creator_id = NULL) available to all users globally.

1. Database Seeding (The Content) Please seed the challenges table with these 14 fixed challenges. Map them to the specific Day of the Week. Note on Sorting: ASC means Lower is Better (Time), DESC means Higher is Better (Reps).

MONDAY (Engine):

Burpee AMRAP (7 min) | Type: Reps | Sort: DESC

Dead Hang Pull-Ups | Type: Reps | Sort: DESC

TUESDAY (Foundation): 3. Hindu Squats (100 reps) | Type: Time | Sort: ASC (Faster is better) 4. Knuckle Push-Ups (2 min) | Type: Reps | Sort: DESC

WEDNESDAY (Evasion): 5. Shuttle Runs (Suicide Mile) | Type: Time | Sort: ASC 6. Hardstyle Plank | Type: Time | Sort: DESC (Longer is better)

THURSDAY (Explosion): 7. Broad Jumps (Max Dist) | Type: Distance | Sort: DESC 8. Hanging Leg Raises (to 50) | Type: Sets/Count | Sort: ASC (Fewer sets is better)

FRIDAY (Animal): 9. Bear Crawl (5 min) | Type: Distance | Sort: DESC 10. Wall Sit | Type: Time | Sort: DESC

SATURDAY (Defense): 11. The Sprawl (Tabata Score) | Type: Reps | Sort: DESC 12. Walking Lunges (400m) | Type: Time | Sort: ASC

SUNDAY (Flow): 13. Jump Rope (Misses in 10m) | Type: Count | Sort: ASC (Lower is better) 14. Wrestler's Bridge | Type: Time | Sort: DESC

2. The New Scoring Matrix (Local vs. Global) Update the submitChallenge backend logic to apply these exact fixed values for General Challenges. Do not use the old difficulty multipliers for these.

Scenario A: Trust System (No Video / Free User)

Local XP: 20 XP (Fixed)

Global Rank Score: 5 Points

Scenario B: Video Proof (Premium User)

Local XP: 40 XP (Fixed - 2x Boost)

Global Rank Score: 15 Points (3x Boost)

3. Frontend Logic & Premium Features

Daily Rotation: On the Arena page, ONLY display the 2 challenges corresponding to the current Day of the Week.

Infinite Replayability: Users can submit these every week.

Personal Best (PB): Fetch the user's best previous score for this challenge. Display: "Beat your PB: [X]".

Premium Lock:

The "Submit Video (+40 XP)" button must be LOCKED 🔒 for Free users.

Clicking it opens the Premium Upsell Modal.

Verification Badge:

In Leaderboards, if a record has a video (Premium), display a Gold "Verified" Badge 🥇.

Trust System records get a standard Grey checkmark.

4. Backend "Best Score" Logic When saving a new submission for these recurring challenges:

Compare the new score with the user's existing personal_best in the database.

If New Score > Personal Best (or < for timed events), trigger a "New Record!" celebration event in the UI.
